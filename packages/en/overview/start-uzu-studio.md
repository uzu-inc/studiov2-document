# How to Log In

After creating an account in the [Uzu App](https://uzu.one/app/dl), log in to Uzu Studio using the same account. If you don't have an Uzu account yet, please download the app first and create an account.

Most users have registered their phone numbers in the Uzu App, so we recommend logging in with "**Phone Number Login**."

You can access Uzu Studio from [this link](https://studio.uzu-app.com/). Bookmarking the page is recommended for easy access.

If you have linked external services to your Uzu account, you can also log in using those methods.
