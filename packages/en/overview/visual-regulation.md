# Key Visual Creation Regulations

We have established regulations for the key visuals (cover images, title images) used in scenarios posted from Uzu Studio.

## ① Create the Image with a 16:9 Aspect Ratio

Key visuals created with an aspect ratio other than 16:9 will not display correctly in the app.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## ② Ensure Readable Contrast for the Title

If the contrast between the background image and the title text is too weak, readability will decrease. Please create your visual with contrast in mind.

{% hint style="success" %}
**What is 'contrast'?** \
In this context, contrast refers to the difference in brightness, saturation, and hue in the key visual.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### How to Improve Contrast

▷ Adjust the text color

▷ Outline the title text

▷ Add shadows behind the title text

▷ Add a subtle black or white overlay to the background image

{% hint style="info" %}
**Advanced Note**

In the "bad example" and "good example" above, the adjustments made improve readability by adjusting "brightness" and "hue." However, there is one additional point to be mindful of: **halation**.

Halation occurs when the "brightness" of colors is similar, and the "saturation" is high, causing an eye-straining effect. It results in poor visibility, so it's best to avoid this as well.
{% endhint %}

## ③ Ensure the Title (Main Subject) is Readable Even When the Image is Reduced

### How to Improve Readability

▷ Increase the font thickness

▷ Increase the font size

{% hint style="success" %}
In the Uzu App's scenario list, key visuals are displayed at "160px ✕ 90px." It's a good idea to shrink your visual to this size and check its readability.
{% endhint %}

## ④ Include the Full Title in the Image for Scenario Details Display

If you include other text besides the title, ensure that the title is the most prominent in terms of font size.

## ⑤ About Furigana (Pronunciation Guides)

Uzu Studio has a "furigana entry field," but this is only for hiragana searches in the app. Furigana will not be displayed in the app itself.

If you do not add furigana to the title or include a pronunciation guide in the author comments, please include furigana in the key visual. Here are the situations where furigana is necessary:

{% hint style="info" %}
① When the title includes generally difficult-to-read kanji

② When there are multiple possible readings

③ For proper nouns

④ For words written with ateji (phonetic kanji characters)

⑤ For uncommon English or foreign words
{% endhint %}

## ⑥ Ensure That Materials Used Do Not Violate Copyright or Publicity Rights

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is copyright?** (Simple explanation)

Copyright is the right given to creators of "works" to prevent their creations from being copied or used without permission, including on the internet.

In key visuals, using illustrations or image materials without permission from the rights holder can be considered copyright infringement, so be careful.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is the right of publicity?** (Simple explanation)

The right to protect the name or likeness of a well-known person with commercial value.

Using photos of famous individuals without permission can infringe on their publicity rights, so be cautious.
{% endhint %}

If you have special reasons for wanting to use a key visual that does not conform to these regulations, please include an explanation during the review process.
