# Submitting Your Work

## Submitting Your Work for Review

Once test plays and revisions are completed, it's time to submit your work for review.

Navigate to the " **Release Management** " screen from the home page, and click the " **Submit for App Listing** " button.

The review process is divided into a " **Simplified Review** " for works planned for **free** release and a "[ **Detailed Review** ](check.md)" for works planned for **paid** release. After pressing the submission button, select which review to submit to from the **form**, and fill out the necessary details.

A simplified review for free release works will take approximately 1–2 business days, while a detailed review for paid release works will take about 3 business days (excluding weekends and holidays).

Since you may be asked to make revisions or resubmit, if you have a desired release date, please submit your work with plenty of time in advance (※In some cases, it may not be possible to meet your requested date depending on the situation).

※ You can still make edits to the scenario content after submitting it for review, but the review will be based on the content as it appears in Uz Studio at the time the reviewer checks it.
