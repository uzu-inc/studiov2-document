### (5. Revision & Resubmission_Creator)

If you receive "Revise and Resubmit" or "Insufficient Quality", please correct the indicated issues and resubmit (return to step 1).

After passing the review, preparations for publication will proceed in the individual channels on Uz Studio's official Discord server. You will be asked to provide the following information in a publication preparation form:

- **Scenario Overview** for posting via the Uz official account:
  - Title
  - Author name: Co-authorship is also allowed.
  - Number of players
  - Playtime
  - Synopsis
- **Play Fee**:
  - If you wish to have a sale: the price and the period.

### 7. Publication

At 18:00 on the confirmed publication date, a post about the work's release will be made by the Uz official account, and the work will be **released** on the Uz app.

## Q&A

If you still have questions after reading the following content, please mention "@Editorial Team" in the "Questions & Requests" text channel on the Discord server.

<details>

<summary>Do I need to pass the detailed review even for works that I wish to release for free?</summary>

Works that are to be released for free do not need to go through the detailed review. We will continue to conduct a simplified review as before.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is it possible to publish a work for free initially and switch to paid later after passing the detailed review?</summary>

Paid scenarios released after detailed review are intended for paid publication, so only sales are allowed. If you wish to run a sale, please indicate this in the free text section of the review submission form, such as "Sale at n coins until m/d".

</details>

<details>

<summary>What should I do if I want to monetize a work that was previously released for free or initially planned to be free?</summary>

This policy only applies if the work was originally released with no intention of monetizing. If you intend to monetize, please submit it for detailed review for paid works from the beginning.

Reposting or new scenario listing cannot be done after monetization, so transitioning to a paid work later has limited benefits. We recommend starting as a paid release.

Select "Yes" for the option to monetize from the review submission form and submit it for detailed review.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)

- For v1 works: Click "Submit Work" → "Under Review" to open the review submission form.
- For v2 works: From the " **Release Management** " screen in Uz Studio, click "Submit for Monetization" to proceed to the review submission form.

As mentioned earlier, there is a section to submit test play survey results in the detailed review, but for works transitioning to paid after release, the process is as follows:

- **If no surveys were collected during pre-release test plays**\
  You do not need to attach survey results when submitting for detailed review. We will refer to post-release data.
- **If surveys were collected during pre-release test plays**\
  Please attach the survey results when submitting for detailed review.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How should I handle test plays and survey collection for works already sold outside Uz?</summary>

Test plays must be conducted at least three times, including **at least one** on Uz.

Example ①: You conducted three or more test plays before external sales\
→ After implementation on Uz, conduct at least one test play using Uz and collect surveys. If fewer than three surveys are collected on Uz, you may retroactively collect surveys from external test plays.

Example ②: You conducted one test play before external sales\
→ After implementation on Uz, conduct at least two more test plays, bringing the total to three. Survey collection follows the same process as Example ①.
