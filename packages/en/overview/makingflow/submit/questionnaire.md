# How to Use the Test Play Survey

## Preparing for Test Play

### ◆ Preparation: Creating a Google Account

You need a Google account to use the test play survey.

If you don’t have an account, please refer to the [Google Account Creation Guide (Official)](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) and create one.

If you already have an account, staying logged in will make the following steps smoother.

### ◆ Customizing

As a premise, Uz Studio Editorial Team conducts the detailed review based on the preset survey items. Please **do not delete the preset questions** when creating a copy of the survey. We also ask that you avoid making any structural changes that would significantly alter the format.

You are free to add additional questions if needed.

#### Customization 1: Changing the Title

You can change the management title (in the dotted box on the top left) and the survey title (in the large central box) to something like "Test Play Survey for (Scenario Name)". It’s also a good idea to change ‘(Scenario Name)’ in the description to your scenario title.

#### Customization 2: Changing Character Names and Number of Characters

Please enter the character names and adjust the number of playable characters according to your scenario by adding or removing PCs as necessary.
