# What is Uzu Studio

Uzu Studio is a scenario creation tool developed by the team behind the Murder Mystery call app "**Uzu**."

Scenarios created in Uzu Studio can be published on Uzu after undergoing a review process.

You can create everything necessary for a **typical Murder Mystery** game, including script reading for openings and endings, character texts, clue investigations, discussions (including secret talks), voting, and branching based on votes or selections.

The **content you input and create is directly reflected in Uzu**, allowing it to be played as a **Murder Mystery game without the need for a GM (game master)** on the app.

Thanks to the tool, it's easy to create, even if you have no GM experience. Once your scenario is published, many people can enjoy playing it through the app, making it **a great option for first-time creators**!
