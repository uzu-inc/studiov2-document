# Distributing All Endings

In v1, all endings were forcibly revealed during the post-game discussion, but in v2, creators can now decide whether or not to show endings that the players did not pass through.

This guide explains how to make all endings viewable on the post-game discussion screen.

\

## Method 1: Distribute Endings on the "Thank You" Screen

**① Add a "Thank You" Phase**

From the phase list screen, click "Add Phase" and select a "Basic" phase to create. You can customize the content of the phase freely.

**② Place the "Thank You" Phase Just Before the Post-Game Discussion Screen**

From the phase list screen, proceed to "Set Phase Progress" and insert the phase you added in step ① just before the post-game discussion screen.

**③ Distribute Endings as Text**

From the phase list, go to the editing screen of each ending phase, and check the option "Distribute as text" under "Record Phase Content."
