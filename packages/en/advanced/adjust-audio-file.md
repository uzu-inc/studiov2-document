# Adjust the volume of the audio file itself

When downloading audio from free sound source websites, the default volume may sometimes be too loud. In such cases, here's how to adjust the volume of audio files within UZU Studio.

### ① Click the volume adjustment button in the BGM/SE tab

The following screen will appear.

</div>

### ② Adjust the volume of the audio file you want to modify

The values represent the current volume relatively, so the larger the negative value, the quieter the sound, and the larger the positive value, the louder the sound. In most cases, setting the value between -10 to -20 will be sufficiently quiet.

Once you change the volume, you can preview the modified volume by pressing the ▶︎ button.

### ③ Apply the changes

After adjusting the volume, tap the "Apply Changes" button to modify the volume of the audio file. You can adjust the volume of up to 10 files at once.
