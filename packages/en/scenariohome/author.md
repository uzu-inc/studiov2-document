## Displaying as Author

To display a member as an author in the app, you must set this in the "Work Overview," not in the "Members" screen.

In the "Work Overview," enter the **author name** (not the player name) in the author field and set the title (e.g., creator, illustrator). The display in the app will look as shown on the right.

_Note_: How to check your author name  
Once you have created a work and built the latest version at least once, a "Author Page" button will appear in the app’s side menu (assuming you're logged into the app and Uzu Studio with the same account). Click this button to confirm your author name.

## Play Fee Distribution Rate

This is where you set the distribution rate for royalties among members. If only one person is receiving the sales, there is no need to adjust anything from the default 100% setting for yourself.

Any changes will be applied starting from the following month\*. You cannot distribute royalties to members who have not agreed to the "Uzu Studio Paid Release Terms." Members must [agree to the terms](author.md#heno) by clicking the icon in the top right of the production scenario list screen.

## Additional Content Distribution Rate

This is where you set the distribution rate for additional content sales. If only one person is receiving the sales, there is no need to adjust anything from the default 100% setting for yourself.

Any changes will be applied starting from the following month\*. Members who have not agreed to the "Uzu Additional Content Paid Release Terms" cannot be set for distribution. Members must [agree to the terms](author.md#heno) by clicking the icon in the top right of the production scenario list screen.

### Interpretation of "Starting Next Month"

In Uzu Analytics, sales from the start to the end of the month are displayed as a report the following month, and you can submit a payout request starting the following month. If you set the distribution rate during the month when sales occurred, it will be applied to the sales that can be withdrawn in the following month.

#### Examples:

- If you release a paid work on April 1 and set the distribution rate on April 2 → April sales can be requested for withdrawal from May onwards, with the distribution rate set on April 2 applied.
- If the distribution rate is already set on April 1 and you release a paid work on April 2 → April sales can be requested for withdrawal from May onwards, with the distribution rate set on April 1 applied.
- If the distribution rate is already set on March 31 and you release a paid work on April 1 → Since there were no sales in March, it doesn’t matter. April sales can be requested for withdrawal from May onwards, with the distribution rate set on March 31 applied.
- If you release a paid work on April 1 but forget to set the distribution rate until May 1 → April sales can be requested for withdrawal from May onwards, but the distribution rate won’t apply to April sales (the representative will receive the full payment). May sales (withdrawable from June onwards) will have the distribution rate applied.

In other words, **you must set the distribution rate either before the release or during the release month**. If the month passes without setting the distribution rate, **the operations team cannot rectify it**, so please be mindful of this.
