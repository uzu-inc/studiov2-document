# Work Overview

In the work overview, you set the information that will be publicly available before the scenario is played in the app.

## Cover Image

You can set or change the image by clicking on the image area. Make sure to follow the [key visual creation regulations](../../overview/visual-regulation.md) and set an image with a 16:9 aspect ratio.

In addition to the key visual, you can also set sub-images for character introductions or scenario overviews. For the rules regarding sub-images, please refer to [this page](sub.md).

## Title

This is the title that will be displayed in the app.

If the title falls into any of the following categories, you must either include **furigana** (reading guide) in the title, provide a pronunciation guide in the author’s comment section, or include the furigana in the key visual:

{% hint style="info" %}
① Includes kanji that are generally considered difficult to read  
② Contains kanji with multiple possible readings  
③ Includes proper nouns  
④ Uses ateji (kanji used for phonetic purposes)  
⑤ Includes uncommon English or foreign words
{% endhint %}

_Note_: When adding furigana to a title, avoid formats like `難読(なんどく)漢字`, as it will be harder to find when searching for "難読漢字". Instead, use `難読漢字(なんどくかんじ)`.

## Furigana

This field is referenced when searching for the scenario in hiragana within the app. Only **hiragana** can be entered.

## Genre

Set the genre based on which type of players you want to attract the most. This will be reflected in the genre filter on the scenario list and event list screens in the app.

_Note_: This is not meant to define the genre itself.

## Play Time

This is the total time from gathering to dispersal. Include time for character selection and wrap-up discussions to allow some flexibility.

Example: Play time 60 minutes = 45 minutes of scenario + 15 minutes for character selection and wrap-up.

## Shortened Title

This is used for invites and hashtags when posting impressions in the app. You can use the full title if you'd like. Keep in mind that punctuation marks (。,、) and certain symbols (！？) won’t be included in the hashtag.

## Author

You can set the author to be displayed on the scenario details screen in the app.

Click the "Add" button and enter the author’s name (not the player name) to see suggestions. Enter relevant roles such as creator or illustrator.

_Note_: How to check your author name  
Once you’ve created a work and built the latest version at least once, a "Author Page" button will appear in the app’s side menu (assuming you're logged into the app and Uzu Studio with the same account). Click this button to confirm your author name.

## Tags

These tags indicate the tendencies and themes of the scenario and are used in the scenario search within the app.

_Note_: The tags "Uzu Exclusive," "Includes BGM/SE," and "Easy to Play Face-to-Face (No Secret Conversations)" are set by the operations team when the scenario is published.

## Scenario Tendencies

As murder mysteries have expanded, specialized works and similar genres have developed. At Uzu, we interpret "Madamis" as **content that allows players to immerse themselves in and experience the story as a character**, rather than just as a genre.

To avoid mismatches between players and scenarios, which is important for both authors and players, please include information about the tendencies of the scenario. Here are some examples:

> **Examples**  
> ・Closed-type murder mystery.  
> ・Open-type murder mystery.  
> ・For beginners (intermediate, advanced players).  
> ・A scenario that focuses on deduction and strategy.  
> ・No clear deduction pathway.  
> ・A work that emphasizes role-playing.  
> ・A story-playing scenario.  
> ・A scenario with strong story-playing elements.  
> ・Werewolf-style murder mystery.  
> ・A non-typical murder mystery with special elements.  
> ・A scenario with a lot of reading.  
> ・A scenario with a large amount of text and information.

## Cautions

Since murder mysteries don’t reveal much about the content beforehand and players cannot leave mid-session, providing warnings before play is crucial. While balancing potential spoilers and misleads, be sure to include important information.

### ① Warnings About Content and Themes (Required)

If the scenario contains content that some people may find uncomfortable or deals with sensitive themes, be sure to include a warning.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Examples**

・Graphic descriptions  
・Cruel depictions (torture, abuse, rape, etc.)  
・Traumatizing content  
・Animal cruelty  
・Implied sexual content  
・Discriminatory expressions  
・Suicide  
・Death game  
・Horror  
・Yuri/BL themes
{% endhint %}

_Note_: Even if proper warnings are provided, scenarios that violate Uzu Studio’s terms of service may require adjustments or may not be accepted for publication.

Since Uzu doesn’t have an age restriction system, scenarios containing adult (R18) content may also require adjustments or may not be accepted for publication.

### ② Series or Related Works (Required)

If the scenario is part of a series or requires players to have played another scenario beforehand, make sure to mention that.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Examples**

・Please play the first work in the ○○ series before playing this.  
・This scenario contains spoilers for the series ‘○○’. Please play that first.  
・If you haven’t played ‘○○’, please refrain from participating.
{% endhint %}

### ③ Warnings About Play Time (Required)

If your scenario includes **open discussion phases without a timer**, be sure to note that it may run over the estimated time.

Uzu allows the creation of consecutive event schedules with a 10-minute buffer after the expected end time, but we recommend setting a generous playtime based on test play results to avoid players being late for the next event.

### ④ Warnings About Play Difficulty or Audience (Optional)

If the scenario has specific difficulty levels or is targeted at beginners or advanced players, you can note that here, or in the scenario tendency section mentioned earlier.

### ⑤ Other Warnings (Optional)

Here are some other possible warnings you might want to include:

{% hint style="warning" %}
・We recommend preparing notes.  
・Some sections of the scenario have special progression mechanics, so please read the instructions carefully.  
・Includes external links.  
・Characters may die.  
・There is no happy ending.  
・This scenario includes a bittersweet (melancholy) ending.
{% endhint %}

## Synopsis

The synopsis is the only concrete information players will have about the scenario before playing. Try to make it intriguing and exciting to encourage players to play.

{% hint style="success" %}
Key elements to include:

・World setting  
・Location (when/where)  
・The story or events that players will experience (who/why/what/how)
{% endhint %}

Craft the synopsis to convey the atmosphere and feel of the scenario.

## Creator's Comments

While not mandatory, here are some tips if you choose to add creator comments.

### ① Comments

You can include comments about what kind of scenario it is, key points, what inspired you to create it, and any recommendations on who to play it with.

### ② Credits

List any credits for illustrations, BGM/SE, collaborators, etc., as needed.

_Note_: If the terms of use require displaying credits on the top screen, be sure to include them.

### ③ Update History

If you’ve made updates to the scenario, you can use this section to list the update history.

### ④ Sales/Price Changes

You can also use this section to announce sales or price changes.

## Related Scenarios

{% hint style="info" %}
**Examples of Using the Related Scenarios Feature**

・Scenarios that need to be played beforehand (e.g., previous entries in a series)  
・Demo versions of the scenario (e.g., a free demo for a paid scenario)  
・Alternative versions of the scenario (e.g., with or without a GM)
{% endhint %}

**Please note that the Related Scenarios feature is not for "unrelated works by the same author" or "advertising unrelated works."**

For long series with many works, use the [Collection feature](../../top/collection.md) instead of listing every related scenario. Listing just the previous work in the series as a related scenario is acceptable.

## Role Assignment Hints

If hints for character selection are needed, include them here.

{% hint style="info" %}

・Character A is not the culprit.  
・Character B has a different play experience from others.  
・Character C has a lot of lines to read.  
・For a character quiz, click here → URL
