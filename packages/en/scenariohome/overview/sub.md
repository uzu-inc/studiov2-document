# Setting Sub-Images

In addition to the key visual, you can set up to 10 sub-images for your cover.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (147).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Please follow the rules below when setting sub-images:

- The key visual must always be set as the top image, not as a sub-image.
- Do not upload content that violates public morals or decency.

- Pre-play cards or screenshots that players can use
  {% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}

- Content containing spoilers for the scenario
- Advertisements leading to external websites
- Unrelated content
