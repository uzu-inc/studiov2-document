# SE & Narration

SE (Sound Effects) and narration are used for playing sounds that are played only once, such as sound effects or narration during the read-along phase.

### Setting Playback Conditions

Unlike BGM, SE is intended to be played only once, so there are no stop conditions.

From "Add Playback Condition," set the conditions under which the sound will play. The sound will be played once when the conditions are met.

You can set multiple conditions, and the sound will play each time any of the conditions are fulfilled.

### Playback Settings During the Read-Along Phase

If you want to play a sound during the read-along phase, you need to configure the "cue" settings.

Cues can be set from each line of dialogue in the read-along phase.
