BGM is primarily used for soundtracks that are repeatedly played during specific phases.

### BGM Playback Conditions

Once you upload the BGM, set the playback conditions.

For playback conditions, you need to set both a starting point and an ending point.

Here's an example of the actual settings.

To ensure seamless playback, you can set the phase where one BGM stops as the phase where another BGM starts.

### Playing the Same Audio Continuously from a Certain Phase

If you want to play the same audio continuously, for example, from the ending to the post-game discussion, set the stop condition to "Always disabled."
