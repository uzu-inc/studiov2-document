## Adding PC or NPC

To add a character, click "Add Character" in the top right of the list screen. When adding, choose either **Player Character** or **NPC**. For NPCs, you can select whether or not to display them in the "Character Introduction during gameplay" from the individual character editing screen.\\

Examples of characters to display:

- Victims
- Important NPCs in the story\\

Examples of characters not to display:

- NPCs known only to a few characters
- NPCs that only appear in the read-along, like a "detective"

\\

## Deleting a Character

To **delete** a character, press the "..." button at the top right of the individual character editing screen.

From the "..." button, you can also choose to "**Change to NPC**" or "**Duplicate Character**."

\\

## End Cards

You can set an end card for each player character.

The recommended size is "16:9" (width:height).

## Conditional Settings for Icon and Nickname

The icon and nickname displayed at the top of the screen during gameplay and in the read-along can be changed based on conditions.

For example, in the image, when "Ending 1" starts, it will be revealed that this character is actually "Phantom Thief UZU."
