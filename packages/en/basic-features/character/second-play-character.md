# New Game Plus Characters

The New Game Plus feature was released in May 2024, allowing players to set up characters specifically for repeat gameplay.

Setting up at UzStudio is very simple. Just check the "NG+ Exclusive Character" box in the top right corner of the character edit screen.

## Details of the New Game Plus Feature

- Characters checked as "NG+ Exclusive Character" can only be selected by players who have already played that scenario with other characters, or those who have changed the "Unplayed" button to "Played" on the scenario detail screen.
- Players who have played a scenario with a New Game Plus character set up can only select New Game Plus characters for their second and subsequent plays.
- You can set different playing fees for New Game Plus characters and regular characters. There will be a field to specify this when preparing for publication.
- If you wish to set a GM or facilitator as a New Game Plus character and distribute preparatory materials specific to facilitators, please use the "[Additional Content](../../scenariohome/marketing.md#kontentsuno)" section. Additional content can be viewed before playing once the "Unplayed" button is changed to "Played" on the scenario detail screen.
