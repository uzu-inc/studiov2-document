# Mission

In Uz Studio v2, you can assign **missions** to each character that are automatically determined.

If you want to set a mission, first add the mission tab by clicking the "+" button.\

In the "Title" field, enter the "Mission Description." The "Completion Criteria" can be freely set.\

Example:

- For a deduction mission: when a certain character votes for a certain **option** (culprit)
- For a collection mission: when a certain character possesses a certain **clue**
- For a mission related to a choice: when a certain **ending** is reached\

The missions you set will only be displayed **during the post-game discussion screen**. The mission details **will not be automatically distributed to the text tab of each character**, so itâ€™s okay to set missions that will be revealed during gameplay in the same way.

In other words, if you don't write the mission content in the distributed text, the players won't know about it, so be careful.

Each mission can be assigned a **score**. The **total score** will be displayed on the character list screen, allowing you to check the balance with other characters.

Missions with a score of 0 points will be displayed as achieved/not achieved without a score display in the post-game discussion screen.
