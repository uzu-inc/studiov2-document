# Rooms

Rooms are places where calls, such as general discussions and private conversations, are conducted.

On the app, they are displayed in the upper right corner.

There must always be at least one room **that can be used by everyone in all phases**, so it cannot be deleted (the one on the far left in the image).

## Private Conversation Rooms

If you just need to set the phases in which private conversations can occur, select the phases from the checkbox.

If you want to set more detailed conditions, click on "Usage Conditions".

## Conditional Room Names

The main room name, which is always displayed in the upper right corner during play as the basic room, can be changed based on conditions.

For example, it's useful when you want to create a scenario where you're on the "1st floor" in Phase 1, on the "2nd floor" in Phase 2, and in the "corridor" in Phase 3, with the location changing as the phases progress.
