# Game Flow Display Phase

The game flow display phase illustrates the **entire scenario flow**, including an opening, character text loading, discussions, moving to voting, and the ending. It also helps players understand where they are in the game and what phase will come next.

In version 1, the game flow was automatically displayed between all phases, but in version 2, you can choose where to display it. You can proceed without inserting it between phases where you do not want to interrupt the flow.

The game flow phase can be configured from the detailed screen of each game's flow phase.

### Basic Items

The basic items are "Phase Name," "Phase Description," and "Duration of Phase."

Each is displayed as follows.

### Corresponding Phases (Mandatory)

Choose the phases that correspond to each game flow from the timeline-unset phases.

You can set **multiple phases** in one display. The order of the phases can be changed, but the order does not matter.

### Display Conditions (Optional)

You can set when specific items will be **hidden** and from when they will be displayed.

This is effective, for example, if there is a secret phase that only appears after a certain ending, or if there are additional discussions that are not revealed at the beginning of the game.

You do not need to set this for phases where there is no need to hide anything, such as the opening, character text loading, and regular discussions.
