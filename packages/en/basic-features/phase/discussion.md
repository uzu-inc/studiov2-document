## Distributing Phase Content as Text

If you want to distribute the information displayed on the common screen during this phase to the **text tab** as well (to make it reviewable later), set it up from the menu on the right.

If you want to add synchronized text (cannot be edited from the text side; editing on the phase side automatically reflects on the text) with the phase content\
→ Just turn ON "Distribute as Text" for phase content recording.

If you want to add copied text (can be edited from the text side) from the currently inputted phase content:

1. Press "Add +" for distribution.
2. Select text.
3. Open the distribution text field.
4. Select "Copy of this phase".

Synchronized text is useful for adding rule explanations and common information, while copied text is convenient for content that requires individual editing.
