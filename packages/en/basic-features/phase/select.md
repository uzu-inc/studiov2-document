# Voting Phase

In the voting phase, you can conduct various types of votes, including voting for suspects. With UzStudio v2, you can now place a voting phase anywhere, anytime.

Here are the settings for the voting phase.

## Voting Options (Basic)

Set the names and images of the options. The difference in display with or without an image is as follows.

### Phase Completion Conditions

Next Button: You cannot press "Next" unless you have selected a vote. This is recommended for the voting phase.

Time Limit: Even if no selection has been made, the phase will automatically progress once the set timer reaches zero seconds. Be careful when setting a time limit for the voting phase.

## Characters Who Can Vote

Set the characters who can vote in the respective voting phase. By specifying certain characters here, only those characters can vote. This is effective when you want only one representative to cast a vote.

## Characters Who Can View the Vote

Set the characters who can view the contents of the voting phase. If this setting is turned ON, the screens of those characters will show who voted for what with icons. This is effective for preventing duplicate votes.

## Display Voting Results on the Post-Game Screen

The voting results show who voted for which option and how many votes each option received during a particular voting phase. Turning this ON will display the voting results on the post-game screen, and turning it OFF will not.

## Advanced Voting Options

Each option can be set with "Display Conditions" and "Selection Conditions."

"Display Conditions" are settings that make an option appear only when a specific condition is met. If the condition is not met, the option is completely hidden from all characters' screens. Conditions like reaching a certain phase or possessing a specific clue are well-matched with this setting.

"Selection Conditions" allow only certain characters or those meeting specific conditions to vote for an option. Options that cannot be voted on are displayed in a lighter color.

You can also set it so that no more than two people can vote for the same option. This function is mainly aimed at those who want to combine voting and clues to create an investigation phase. For more information on creating an investigation phase, please refer to [this page](../../advanced/investigation.md).
