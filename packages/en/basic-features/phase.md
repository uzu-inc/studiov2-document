## Phases

Phases are the most crucial parts in setting the flow of scenarios in Madame Miss.

There are mainly two screens for setting up phases:

1. [Editing screen for each phase](../basic-features/phase/basic.md)
   → Set the contents of the phase

2. [Phase progression setting screen](../basic-features/phase/flow.md)
   → Set the transitions between phases
