# Post-Game Discussion Screen

The post-game discussion screen is the explanation and results screen displayed after all discussions, voting, and endings have concluded.

In version 1, there was only one option to summarize everything under a tab called "True Explanation Text," but in version 2, **tabs can now be separated by content**.

## Tab Contents

The contents that can be entered in a tab are "Title," "Description," and "Main Text."

You can edit the contents of each tab by clicking on the top right corner of the respective tab.

<div align="left">

The correspondence with the screens in the app is as follows.

## Title Differentiation

You can differentiate the first title displayed on the post-game discussion screen based on conditions.

Generally, it's sufficient to just include the "Basic Title," but by clicking "Add Conditional Ending Title," you can perform more complex differentiation.

### Tab Reordering

You can long-press a tab and switch the display order with other tabs.

### Display List of Undiscovered Clues

By turning on the toggle for the tab labeled "List of Undiscovered Clues" located at the far right of the tab list, a list of clues that no one obtained during the event will be displayed at the end of the post-game tab list.
