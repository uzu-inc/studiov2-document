## Basic Items

The basic items of clues are displayed on the **List of Clues** and **Detail of Clues** screens during play.

The correspondences are as follows:

**Tags** are also related to the filtering search that can be performed during play.

**Whether to display the existence of unpublished clues on the list screen for non-owners** can also be set. Turning this setting ON will make it apparent to others that the person has some clue, even if they are not the owner.

What is displayed on the screen for non-owners are only "Title when private" and "Tags", and the details of the clue are not disclosed.

**About the display of the number of clues**

Only the clues that are "public" and "unpublished but set to display when private" are counted, i.e., those whose existence is clear on the person's screen.

## Distribution Conditions (Optional)

Distribution conditions are set from the '＋ Add' button in the upper right corner. You can decide under what conditions, how, and to whom to distribute.

In distribution methods, whether there is "ownership" of a clue is important. If you own a clue, you can make it public, share it, or transfer it; without ownership, these actions cannot be done.

## Collection Conditions (Optional)

Once distributed, clues remain in play, but by setting collection conditions, you can also return them to a state of non-play.

Collection conditions are set from the '＋ Add' button under the distribution conditions.

You can combine them with distribution conditions to collect them once and redistribute them in the second half, for example.

You can set various conditions for collection, so if you are unfamiliar, please set them while checking the [conditions settings page](condition.md).

If you want to create a scenario with a drastically different look between the first and second half, or if the rules are complex and you need to use sample clues to explain in the first half, please use this feature.

## Conditions for Public Release, Sharing, and Transfer (Optional)

If you want to allow the exchange of clues with other players, set conditions for public release, sharing, and transfer.

The contents are as follows:

| Item                | Display on Uzu App  | Content                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Public              | Public to everyone  | You can make the clue public to everyone.                                                  |
| Share in this space | Information sharing | You can show the clue only to those in the same room, such as during a private discussion. |
| Transfer            | Transfer            | You can select one person and transfer the clue to them.                                   |

Settings include "Simple Settings" and "Advanced Conditions Settings".

Simple settings allow you to set public release, sharing, and transfer only in the basic phases you created.

Advanced conditions settings allow you to include not only phases but also voting results, clue situations, rooms, etc., as conditions.
