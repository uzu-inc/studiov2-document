## Author Page Button

Once you've created at least one version of a scenario, an "Author Page" button will appear on your Uz account linked with Uz Studio.

From the author page, you can check the list of released scenarios and the total number of likes.

※ If you are only a member of someone else's scenario, your author page will not appear. If the author page button does not appear, please create at least one scenario, even if it's a blank one, from the top page of Uz Studio.
