# Agreement to Various Terms and Conditions

You can agree to the terms and conditions by clicking the icon in the top right corner of the scenario list screen.

If you are releasing paid content or selling additional paid content, all individuals who will receive sales proceeds must agree to the terms from their respective accounts.

Please note, especially for paid content, if even one person has not clicked the agreement button, the management side will not be able to set the play fee.
