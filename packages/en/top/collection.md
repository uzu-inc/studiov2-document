# Collection Feature

## How to Set Up

You can configure collections from the Uzu Studio home screen (Scenario List screen).

**① Click "New Collection" in the left menu.**

**② Enter the Collection Title** (which will appear in app searches) **and Description, then add the works you want to include.**  
**Note:** Only works where you are the administrator can be added.

{% hint style="warning" %}

### Important Notes

- A scenario can only belong to one collection.
- When using common terms like "Detective Series" or "Youth Series," make sure to distinguish your collection by adding something unique (e.g., "○○'s Detective Series" or "Youth Series (○○)").
- If you try to enter a collection name that is already in use, an error message will appear.

## Appearance in the App

In the app, a collection view button appears below the key visual on the Scenario Details screen.

When tapping the collection name, users can view the collection details, including the **total number of likes**, the **list of authors** of the works in the collection, and the **list of works**. The works are displayed in the order they were released, regardless of the order in the Uzu Studio collection editing screen.

## Difference Between the Collection and Related Scenarios Features

{% hint style="info" %}

### Use Case Examples for the Collection Feature

- Organizing series works
- Grouping works by the same author and genre
- Gathering project-related works
  {% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}

### Use Case Examples for the Related Scenarios Feature

- A scenario that must be played before another (e.g., a previous work in a series)
- A demo version of the scenario (e.g., a free demo of a paid scenario)
- A different version of the same scenario (e.g., with or without a GM)
  {% endhint %}

**The Related Scenarios feature is not meant for works that are simply from the same author or for unrelated works.**

For large series, use the Collection feature instead of listing every scenario as related. Listing only the previous work as a related scenario is acceptable.
