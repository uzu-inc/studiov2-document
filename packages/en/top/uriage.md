# Receiving Sales Proceeds

To receive sales proceeds, you need to set up your "Bank Account Information" and submit a "Payment Request."

## Setting Up Bank Account Information

You can set up your bank account information by clicking the icon in the top right corner of the scenario list screen in Uz Studio.

## Submitting a Payment Request

Sales are tallied at the end of each month, and you will be able to submit a payment request starting from the following month. Payment requests can be made from the "Ratings & Earnings" screen.

The total sales available for a payment request will be displayed under "Unpaid Amount" on the "Ratings & Earnings" screen.

By clicking the "View Details" button and then the "Payment Request" button, your request will be completed. Payments are processed from the 20th of the month after the request is made.

From the 20th to the end of each month, the system is processing, and the payment request button will be unavailable.
